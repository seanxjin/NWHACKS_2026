### *don’t keep in your crash outs*  
**are you ready to rambl?**

**rambl** is a high-empathy mental health support app built for one thing:  
helping you **let it out safely** when you’re emotionally overloaded, *then* helping you **calm down and make a plan** when you’re ready.

rambl is built to de-escalate your crashouts. It’s designed for the “emotional overwhelm” moment: when your brain is too stressed to problem-solve, and you just need somewhere judgment-free to unload.

## what is rambl?

### 1) The Vent (Total Catharsis)
You open the app and **talk or type freely**.  
No interruptions. No “helpful hints.” No lectures.  
Just a space to **get it out**.

**Voice mode** makes it feel like you’re talking to a real friend who’s simply there.

### 2) The Empathy (Validation first)
When you’re done, the AI **doesn’t jump into fix-it mode**.  
It responds with **high-empathy validation** to help your intensity drop.
The goal is to help you feel heard, grounded, and less activated.

### 3) The Game Plan (Only when you click)
When you’re ready and willing, you tap a button and rambl turns your vent into a **clear, doable plan**, including:

- A quick way to calm down **right now**
- A simple “script” for tough conversations  
- 1–2 small actions you can do **today**

## Why it exists

When emotions spike, advice can feel annoying or impossible to apply.  
rambl flips the order:

**Feel heard → calm down → think clearly → take action**

## Key Features

### “Crash Out → Calm Out” flow
- Vent freely (no interruptions)
- Get validated (no fixing)
- Build a plan (only when invited)

### Voice that feels human
Powered by **ElevenLabs** for a calm, friendly tone (no robotic vibes).

### Privacy-first by default
- Designed to be **judgment-free + private**
- Optional **auto-delete** so raw vents don’t live past the session

### Inner Circle
If your trusted people are asleep/busy, you can send them a **short summary** of what’s going on — without dumping 10 minutes of rant text.

### Patterns
Over time, rambl can gently surface trends like:
- “You’ve vented about your boss four times this week”
- “You feel most overwhelmed on Sunday nights”

(So you can spot what’s actually draining you.)
